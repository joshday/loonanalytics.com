        </p>

        <h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>

        <h4>Fees for Paid Services</h4>
        <p>
          Some of our Services are offered for a fee ("Paid Services").  By using a Paid Service, you 
          agree to pay the specified fees and fees associated with specific features).  Depending on 
          the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee, recurring fees, or usage-based fee. For 
          recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals 
          (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you 
          can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.
        </p>

        <h4>Taxes</h4>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are 
          exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods 
          and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the 
          future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your 
          use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect 
          Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may 
          collect payment for such Taxes.
        </p>

        <h4>Payment</h4>
        <p>
          If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may 
          immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or 
          credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may 
          revoke your access to our Services in general.</p>

        <h4>Automatic Renewal</h4>
        <p>
          To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This 
          means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription 
          period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment 
          mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well 
          as any Taxes). Your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your 
          original subscription period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of 
          the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email 
          (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you 
          in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based 
          on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
        </p>

        <h4>Canceling Automatic Renewal</h4>
        <p>
          We do not have a subscription plan yet, but when we do, you will be able to cancel anytime from your user account page.
        </p>

        <h4>Fee Changes</h4>
        <p>
          We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously 
          free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree 
          with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
        </p>

        <h4>Refunds</h4>
        <p>
          While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, 
          unless otherwise required by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Specific Service Terms</h2>

        <h2>8. Copyright Infringement</h2>

          As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual 
          property rights of others. 
        </p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Agreement does not transfer from Loon Analytics to you any Loon Analytics or third party 
          intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will 
          remain (as between the parties) solely with Loon Analytics. Loon Analytics, the Loon 
          Analytics logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in 
          connection with Loon Analytics or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of

          Loon Analytics or third party trademarks.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal 
          terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will 
          let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other 
          communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period 
          of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then 
          you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes 
          become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. 
          However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms 
          (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute 
          arose.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without 
          cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the 
          obligation) to, in our sole discretion,terminate or deny access to and use of any of our 
          Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a 
          refund of any amounts previously paid.

        <p>If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your Loon Analytics account, you may simply 
          discontinue using our Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any 
          time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall 
          survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty 
          disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

        </p>

        <p>
          In no event will Loon Analytics, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to

          (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of 
          use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you

          of action. Loon Analytics shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters 
          beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by 
          applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Loon Analytics, its contractors, and its licensors, 
          and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all

        <h2>15. Economic Sanctions</h2>
        <p>
          You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and/or associated 
          services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited,

        <h2>16. Translation</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other

          English version, the English version will control.

        <p>
          The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Loon Analytics and you concerning the 
          subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that 
          part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions 
          will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of 
          the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or 
          condition or any subsequent breach thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to 
          be bound by, its terms and conditions; Loon Analytics may assign its rights under the 
          Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the
